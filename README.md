## Featured Projects

### Car Sharing Optimization in Groningen
- **Objective:** Improve profitability and customer satisfaction for a car-sharing service in Groningen by analyzing demand patterns and optimizing fleet allocation.
- **Tools & Techniques:** Data cleaning and analysis were conducted using Pandas and Elasticsearch, with Matplotlib and Smopy for visualization. The optimization was performed using the Gurobi optimizer.
- **Outcome:** Developed an optimization model that proposed actionable insights for fleet allocation, enhancing service efficiency.

### Asset Management and Maintenance Optimization
- **Objective:** Optimize maintenance policies for machinery through statistical analysis of maintenance data and simulation of maintenance thresholds.
- **Tools & Techniques:** Employed Kaplan-Meier and Weibull analysis for reliability modeling, and Python for simulations to identify cost-effective maintenance thresholds.
- **Outcome:** Offered recommendations for maintenance strategies that balance cost and reliability, based on comprehensive policy comparisons.
